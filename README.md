# SpringboardAPI

SpringboardAPI is a simple boilerplate to help you hit the ground running, or walking if thats more your speed. Skip the painful and monatenous task of creating an API with basic RESTful features and get moving on the stuff that really maters to you.

Let's face it... you don't want to be tied down or boxed in by a framework that does "most" of what you want. You don't want to get 99% of the way through a feature and realize you are being prohibited by the very tool that has helped you get so far already! That is exactly the reason this project exists. It uses well known, well supported libraries, but gives you a solid launchpad to start from.
